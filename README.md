## Technical Analysis of Stocks using Python

This repository provides a detailed guide on how to perform technical analysis of stocks using Python libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. The analysis includes insights derived from daily price-volume stock market data.

## 1. About Data

For this analysis, 2 years of historical data from around mid-Feb 2018 to Feb 2020 of the below stocks listed on National Stock Exchange(NSE) were used:

- HDFC Ltd.
- Sun Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd.
- Tata Consultancy Services Ltd.
- Jindal Steel & Power Ltd.
- Jubilant FoodWorks Ltd.

The selected stocks are from different sectors and market cap.

## 2. Understanding Data & General Statistics

Import necessary libraries:
```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
import datetime
import warnings
warnings.filterwarnings('ignore')
```

Read data from a CSV file and display the first few rows:
```python
HDFC_df = pd.read_csv("your_data_file.csv")
HDFC_df.head()
```

Since our time-frame of analysis is large, we can relax on the number of decimal places to consider. We'll also check for null values and drop them if any.

## 3. General Variation in Stock Price

Before moving on, we set the 'Date' column as the index of the dataframe. This makes plotting easy. We then plot the closing price of the stock over the 2-year period.

## 4. Day-to-Day Percentage Change (Daily Returns)

We calculate the daily percentage change in the stock price and represent it in a plot. This helps in understanding daily stock returns.

## 5. Trend Analysis

We add a new column 'Trend' to categorize daily returns into different trends such as 'Slight Positive,' 'Negative,' 'Bull Run,' etc. We visualize the relative frequency of each trend using a pie chart.

## 6. Daily Returns and Volume

We plot the daily returns and juxtapose them with daily trade volume to observe the relationship between trading volume and stock price changes.

## 7. Correlation Analysis Of Stocks

We perform correlation analysis between different stocks and visualize the relationships using pair plots and joint plots. This helps in diversification analysis.

## 8. Volatility Analysis

We analyze the volatility of stocks by calculating 7-day rolling mean and standard deviation. Volatility is compared between different stocks and the NIFTY 50 index.

## 9. Endnotes

This section provides some closing thoughts on the analysis and emphasizes that there is no foolproof strategy for investing in the stock market.
